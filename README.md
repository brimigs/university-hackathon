We want to see you to continue to build on Solana and will have a part 2 for this hackathon where everyone can resubmit your project on 3/1/25. We will review the growth of the project over the past three months and once again award first, second, and third place prizes.

## Advice

**Build in public.** Open source your code, openly discuss your project on Twitter, reach out to other builders.
